finish hard ai

make screen clear at appropriate times
and make buffer screen between each turn that tells player whether they sank miss or hit their opponents ships /the opponent will see this too (and that is on purpose and okay)

allow ships to be placed by one parsed string  (A1 or 1A)

change symbols for ships/water/etc and have more appropriate colors
blue ≈ for waves
green ± for ships
red # for hit ships
magenta ≠ sunk ships

fix malloc error ai


different color combinations are different themes:

apurva's epic theme
max's autumn theme
jace's gamer theme
meet's indian theme
tris chaotic theme

add epic win screen with epic colors
