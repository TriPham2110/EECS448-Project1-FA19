how I got this to compile on windows:

download msys2 and update accordingly as per their website

add mingw64/bin to $path (my msys2/mingw64/bin was in straight up C:)

then

in mingw64 shell or msys2 or whatever run these commands:

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm3
pacman -S pkg-config
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libffi
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
pacman -Sy git
pacman -Sy make
pacman -Sy cmake

then

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/mingw64/lib/pkgconfig

then

open mingw64
cd /path/to/battleship

then

make

and it should take a while and have lots of warnings but will compile
(this is what happened to me)

For mac:

a similar yet slightly simpler process using homebrew instead of mingw64
but similar pkg_config_path commands
